react-dom_client.js?v=0eb0b91e:5594 React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by App. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed. For more information, read the Rules of Hooks: https://react.dev/link/rules-of-hooks

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is experiencing a React Hooks error. The error message is clear:

"React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by App. This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed."

The error shows that there are 50 hooks in the previous render and 51 in the next render. The last hook is shown as `undefined` in previous render and `useEffect` in the next render, meaning a `useEffect` hook is being called conditionally or the order of hooks is changing between renders.

The specific error is:
```
51. undefined                 useEffect
```

This means there's a `useEffect` that's being called conditionally or after a conditional return, or the hooks order is somehow changing between renders.

Let me read the App.tsx file to understand what's happening, particularly around line 465 where the stack trace shows the error is occurring.</details></think>

---

I can see the issue - there's a React Hooks error indicating that hooks are being called in a different order between renders. This typically happens when hooks are called conditionally or the number of hooks changes between renders.

Let me examine the `App.tsx` file to identify the problem:

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/App.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see the problem! Looking at line 387, there's a conditional return statement:

```javascript
if (isLoading) {
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

This happens AFTER the useEffect hooks at lines 277 and 378, but the issue is that hooks must always be called in the same order. The error message shows that there are 50 hooks in one render and 51 in another, with the additional hook being a `useEffect`.

Let me check if there's an early return that might be causing the hooks to not be called consistently. Let me look for where `isLoading` is set and if there are any other conditional returns before the hooks.</details></think>

---

I found the problem! Looking at the code structure, there's a conditional return at line 387 that appears **after** the `useEffect` hooks. In React, all hooks must be called before any conditional returns. Let me check the full structure:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/App.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the full structure. The hooks are at lines:
- Line 168: `useAuth()` (which is a custom hook that uses `useContext`)
- Lines 170-238: Multiple `useState` calls
- Line 277: First `useEffect`
- Line 378: Second `useEffect`
- Line 387: Conditional return `if (isLoading)`
- Line 465: Third `useEffect`

The problem is clear: there's a conditional return at line 387 that happens between the second and third `useEffect`. This means sometimes the third `useEffect` is called (when `isLoading` is false) and sometimes it's not (when `isLoading` is true), which violates the Rules of Hooks.

The solution is to move all `useEffect` calls before any conditional returns. Let me check what the third useEffect does and then restructure the code.</details></think>

---

I found the issue! There's a conditional return statement at line 387 (`if (isLoading)`) that appears **between** the `useEffect` hooks. In React, all hooks must be called before any conditional returns. 

The structure is currently:
1. Line 277: First `useEffect`
2. Line 378: Second `useEffect`
3. Line 387: `if (isLoading) return ...` ← Problem!
4. Line 465: Third `useEffect` ← This hook is after the conditional return

Let me check what's between line 387 and 465:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/App.tsx

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see the structure now:

Lines 386-400: Two conditional returns
- Line 387-396: `if (isLoading) return ...`
- Line 398-400: `if (!isAuthenticated) return <AuthPage />`

Lines 402-462: Function definitions that use state (like `handleGoogleConnect`, etc.)

Line 465: Third `useEffect` that fetches notifications

The problem is that the third `useEffect` is defined AFTER conditional returns. These functions (handleGoogleConnect, handleSyncWithGoogle, handleImportFromGoogle) and the third useEffect need to be moved before the conditional returns.

The fix is to move the third `useEffect` (lines 465-483) to before the conditional returns (before line 387). The function definitions (lines 402-462) can actually stay where they are since they're just function definitions and not hook calls, but it's better practice to move them up as well.

Let me make the fix by moving the useEffect to after line 384 (after the second useEffect).</details></think>

---

Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The third `useEffect` at line 465 is placed **after** the conditional return statements at lines 387-400. This violates the Rules of Hooks - all hooks must be called before any conditional returns.

The fix is to move the third `useEffect` (notification fetching) to before the conditional return statements. Let me do that:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The unused variable error is resolved. There's only one warning left about inline CSS styles (line 1864), which is just a warning and not an error. The main React Hooks error should now be fixed since all hooks are called before the conditional returns.

Let me create a summary of what I fixed for the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the React Hooks error. Here's what I did:

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. **Fixed React Hooks Order Violation** ✅
   - **Problem**: The third `useEffect` (for fetching notifications) was placed **after** conditional return statements (`if (isLoading)` and `if (!isAuthenticated)`), which violates the Rules of Hooks.
   - **Solution**: Moved the notification fetching `useEffect` to before all conditional returns (now at lines 386-405), ensuring all hooks are called in the same order on every render.

### 2. **Removed Duplicate Code** ✅
   - Removed the duplicate `useEffect` block that was left after the move.

### 3. **Fixed Linter Error** ✅
   - Added an eslint-disable comment for the unused `_selectedMembers` parameter in `handleEditContact` function, which is intentionally unused pending future implementation (as noted in the TODO comment).

The app should now load without the React Hooks error. The only remaining item is a minor warning about inline CSS styles, which doesn't affect functionality.

The Google Calendar API credentials warning you see is expected if you haven't set up Google Calendar integration yet (that's a separate configuration issue, not a code error).
