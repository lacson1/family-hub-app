- Complete user workflows
- Cross-component interactions
- API-to-UI data flow

### 3. Real-time Testing
Tests WebSocket functionality:
- Multi-user scenarios
- Broadcast propagation
- Connection recovery
- Heartbeat mechanism

### 4. Performance Testing
Tests system performance:
- Dashboard load time (< 3s)
- Chart rendering responsiveness
- Multiple rapid updates handling
- WebSocket message throughput

### 5. Error Handling
Tests error scenarios:
- API failures
- Network interruptions
- WebSocket disconnections
- Server restarts

## Test Data Strategy

### Mock Data
Tests use:
- Fake user accounts
- Generated task/meal/event data
- Simulated images (Buffer data)
- Mock WebSocket messages

### Cleanup
Tests include cleanup steps:
- Delete test data after each test
- Close browser contexts
- Reset state between tests

## Debugging Tests

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      
      - name: Start services
        run: docker-compose up -d
      
      - name: Wait for services
        run: sleep 10
      
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npx playwright test tests/e2e/comprehensive-enhancements.spec.ts tests/e2e/realtime-websocket.spec.ts
      
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## Known Limitations

### Test Environment Considerations

1. **WebSocket Tests**: Require stable network connection
2. **Timing**: Some tests use `waitForTimeout` which may need adjustment
3. **Browser Differences**: Some features may behave differently across browsers
4. **Mobile Tests**: Require mobile viewport simulation

### Adaptive Tests

Many tests include `.catch()` handlers to:
- Handle different selector implementations
- Accommodate UI variations
- Provide useful error messages
- Continue testing even if specific selectors change

Example:
```typescript
await page.click('[data-testid="add-task-button"]').catch(() => {
    await page.click('button:has-text("Add Task")');
});
```

## Best Practices Followed

### 1. Test Isolation
- Each test is independent
- No shared state between tests
- Proper setup and teardown

### 2. Resilient Selectors
- Prefer `data-testid` attributes
- Fallback to text content or role-based selectors
- Avoid brittle XPath or CSS selectors

### 3. Meaningful Assertions
- Clear expectation messages
- Multiple assertion types
- Graceful handling of optional features

### 4. Performance Awareness
- Tests run in reasonable time
- Parallel execution where possible
- Appropriate timeouts

### 5. Documentation
- Clear test descriptions
- Commented complex logic
- Test purpose explained

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests

When components change:

1. **Update selectors** if `data-testid` attributes change
2. **Update assertions** if UI text or structure changes
3. **Add new tests** for new features
4. **Remove obsolete tests** for removed features

### Test Health Monitoring

Recommended metrics:
- Test pass rate > 95%
- Average test duration < 30s
- Flaky test rate < 5%
- Code coverage > 80%

## Future Enhancements

Potential test additions:

1. **Visual Regression Testing**
   - Screenshot comparison
   - CSS regression detection

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - WCAG compliance
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support

3. **Load Testing**
   - Concurrent user simulation
   - Stress testing WebSocket

4. **Security Testing**
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection
   - Input validation

## Support

### Troubleshooting

**Tests fail due to timeout**:
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check if services are running
- Verify network connectivity

**WebSocket tests fail**:
- Ensure backend is running
- Check WebSocket URL in `.env`
- Verify CORS configuration

**Selectors not found**:
- Check if component has been integrated
- Verify `data-testid` attributes are present
- Use Playwright Inspector to debug

### Getting Help

1. Check test output and error messages
2. Review test trace (run with `--trace on`)
3. Use Playwright Inspector (`--debug`)
4. Consult Playwright documentation
5. Review `INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.tsx` for component usage
