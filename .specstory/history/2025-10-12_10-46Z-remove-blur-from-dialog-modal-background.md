_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to remove the blur effect at the back of dialog modal. This is likely referring to a backdrop blur effect on modal components. Let me search for the Modal component since that's likely where this styling is applied.

Looking at the project structure, I can see there's a `src/components/Modal.tsx` file. Let me read that first to see how the modal is styled.</details></think>

I'll help you remove the blur effect from the dialog modal backdrop. Let me first check the Modal component to see where the blur is applied.

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/components/Modal.tsx

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I found the blur effect! It's applied to the backdrop of the modal using the `backdrop-blur-sm` class on line 15 and line 58. These are in:
1. The Modal component (line 15)
2. The ConfirmDialog component (line 58)

I need to remove the `backdrop-blur-sm` class from both components. I'll make these changes now.</details></think>

I found the blur effect! It's applied using the `backdrop-blur-sm` class on the modal backdrop. I'll remove it from both the Modal and ConfirmDialog components.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! The second search_replace worked for the ConfirmDialog. Now I need to remove the backdrop-blur-sm from the Modal component on line 15. Let me use more specific context for this one since there are multiple instances.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully removed the `backdrop-blur-sm` class from both the Modal component (line 15) and the ConfirmDialog component (line 58). The backdrop will now show without any blur effect, just the semi-transparent black overlay.

Let me check for any linting errors in the file.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! No linter errors. The changes have been successfully applied. The backdrop-blur-sm class has been removed from both modal components, so the dialog backdrop will no longer have a blur effect.</details></think>

---

Done! I've removed the blur effect from the dialog modal backdrop. The changes affect both:

1. **Modal component** (line 15) - used for general modals
2. **ConfirmDialog component** (line 58) - used for confirmation dialogs

The backdrop will now display as a clean semi-transparent black overlay without any blur effect. The changes are already applied and there are no linter errors.
