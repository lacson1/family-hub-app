## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Questions:

**Q: How do I install the app?**  
A: See installation instructions above for your device. Look for the install prompt or icon in your browser.

**Q: Do I need to be online to use the app?**  
A: After the first load, most features work offline. API calls (saving data) require internet.

**Q: Can multiple family members use it?**  
A: Yes! Each person can install it on their device and share the same family data.

**Q: How do I update the app?**  
A: Updates happen automatically. Just refresh the page or restart the app.

**Q: Can I use it on both phone and computer?**  
A: Absolutely! Install on all your devices for seamless access.

### Troubleshooting:

**Problem: Install button doesn't appear**  
Solution: Make sure you're using Chrome/Edge and have visited the page fully. Or install manually (Share → Add to Home Screen on mobile).

**Problem: App won't work offline**  
Solution: Load the app fully while online first. The service worker needs to cache content.

**Problem: Features not working**  
Solution: Make sure Docker is running (`docker-compose up -d`) for backend features.
