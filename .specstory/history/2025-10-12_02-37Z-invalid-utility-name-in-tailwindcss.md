[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] tailwindcss: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/index.css:1:1: `@utility hover-lift:hover` defines an invalid utility name. Utilities should be alphanumeric and start with a lowercase letter.

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting a Tailwind CSS error. The error message states:

```
tailwindcss: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/index.css:1:1: `@utility hover-lift:hover` defines an invalid utility name. Utilities should be alphanumeric and start with a lowercase letter.
```

This suggests that in the `src/index.css` file, there's a custom utility definition that's using an invalid name format. The utility name `hover-lift:hover` is invalid because utility names should be alphanumeric and can't contain colons in the name itself.

Let me read the `src/index.css` file to see what's there and fix the issue.</details></think>

I can see the issue - there's an invalid custom utility definition in your CSS file. Let me take a look at the `src/index.css` file to fix it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the problem. The `@utility` directive is being used incorrectly on lines 64-71 and 73-79. The syntax `@utility hover-lift:hover` is invalid because:

1. You can't define pseudo-classes (`:hover`) directly in the utility name
2. The newer version of Tailwind CSS v4 uses a different syntax for custom utilities

The fix is to convert these `@utility` declarations to regular CSS classes that follow the proper format. I'll replace them with standard CSS classes using proper selectors.</details></think>

I can see the issue! The `@utility` directive is being used incorrectly with pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:active`. In Tailwind CSS v4, you can't define utilities with pseudo-classes in the name like that. Let me fix this by converting them to regular CSS classes:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've fixed the issue by converting the `@utility` directives to regular CSS classes. The error was caused by using the `@utility` directive with pseudo-class selectors like `:hover` and `:active` in the utility name, which is not valid in Tailwind CSS v4.

The fix converts:
- `@utility hover-lift` and `@utility hover-lift:hover` to `.hover-lift` and `.hover-lift:hover`
- `@utility btn-press` and `@utility btn-press:active` to `.btn-press` and `.btn-press:active`

This should resolve the error and allow the application to compile correctly.</details></think>

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The problem was that the `@utility` directive was being used incorrectly with pseudo-classes (`:hover` and `:active`) in the utility names. 

In Tailwind CSS v4, you can't define custom utilities with pseudo-classes directly in the name like `@utility hover-lift:hover`. I've converted these to regular CSS classes instead:

- `@utility hover-lift` â†’ `.hover-lift`
- `@utility btn-press` â†’ `.btn-press`

The CSS now uses standard class selectors with pseudo-classes (`.hover-lift:hover` and `.btn-press:active`), which will work correctly. The functionality remains the same - you can still use these classes in your components with `className="hover-lift"` and `className="btn-press"`.

The error should now be resolved and your app should compile successfully! ðŸŽ‰
