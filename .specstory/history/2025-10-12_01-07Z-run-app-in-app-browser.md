run app in app browser

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I'll help you run the app in the browser. Let me first check the project structure and then start the development server.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/package.json

---

Perfect! I can see this is a React + Vite project with Tailwind CSS. I'll run the development server using the `dev` script.


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app && npm run dev
```

---

The development server is now starting! Let me check if it's running properly and get the URL:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app && sleep 3 && curl -s http://localhost:5173 > /dev/null && echo "Server is running at http://localhost:5173" || echo "Server might still be starting..."
```

```
Server is running at http://localhost:5173
```

---

Great! Your Family Hub app is now running successfully! ðŸŽ‰

**The app is available at: http://localhost:5173**

You can now:
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. View your React application with Tailwind CSS styling

The development server is running in the background and will automatically reload when you make changes to your code. The app includes:
- React 19.1.1
- Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- TypeScript support

If you need to stop the server later, you can use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or let me know and I can help you manage it.
