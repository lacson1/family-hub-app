<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user just sent "testing" which is a very minimal message. This could mean:
1. They're just testing if the system is working
2. They want to test the application
3. They want help with testing
4. They want to know about the testing setup

Given the context of a family-hub-app project, I should probably acknowledge their message and ask what they'd like to do. Since it's ambiguous, I should provide a helpful response that:
- Acknowledges their message
- Offers some context about what I can help with
- Asks for clarification on what they'd like to do

I should not make assumptions about what they want to test or do any actions without more information.</details></think>

Hello! I'm here to help you with your family-hub-app project. I can see you have a full-stack application with:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Features**: Family members, events, tasks, meals, shopping, budgets, transactions, notifications, calendar integration, and more

What would you like to do? For example, I can help you:
- Run the application and test it
- Add new features or modify existing ones
- Debug issues
- Review the codebase
- Set up or improve tests
- Deploy the application

What did you have in mind?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user just said "1", which seems to be selecting option 1 from the list I provided. Option 1 was "Run the application and test it". Let me help them run the application and test it.

Looking at the project structure, I can see:
- A `Makefile` which might have commands to run the app
- `docker-compose.yml` for Docker setup
- Backend in `backend/` directory
- Frontend in the root with `src/` directory
- Various documentation files

Let me first check what's available in the Makefile to see if there are convenient commands to run the application.</details></think>

I'll help you run the application and test it! Let me check the available commands and get the app running for you.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I can see there are multiple ways to run the app. The easiest would be to use the Makefile commands or the setup script. Let me check if Docker is running first, then start the application.

Based on the documentation:
1. The app uses Docker with docker-compose
2. There's a setup script at `scripts/setup.sh`
3. Or we can use `make setup` or `make start`
4. The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 (frontend) and http://localhost:3001 (backend)

Let me start by checking Docker status and then running the setup.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I can see the app uses Docker. Let me get it running for you. I'll follow these steps:

1. Check if Docker is running
2. Run the setup (creates env files and starts containers)
3. Monitor the startup process
4. Test the application

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker info &> /dev/null && echo "✓ Docker is running" || echo "✗ Docker is not running - please start Docker Desktop"
```

```
✗ Docker is not running - please start Docker Desktop
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Docker is not running. I need to let the user know they need to start Docker Desktop first.</details></think>

---

**Docker is not currently running.** To test the application, you'll need to:

1. **Start Docker Desktop** on your Mac
2. Once Docker is running, come back and I'll start the application

While you're starting Docker, here's what I'll do once it's ready:
- Run the setup to create environment files
- Start all containers (frontend, backend, database)
- Open the app at http://localhost:5173
- Test the API endpoints

Let me know once Docker Desktop is running, or if you'd prefer to test the application locally without Docker (I can help set that up too)!
