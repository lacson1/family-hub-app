<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to run the app. Looking at the project structure, this appears to be a family hub application with:
1. A frontend (React/Vite based on the files I see - vite.config.ts, src/App.tsx, etc.)
2. A backend (Node/Express based on backend/src/index.ts)

To run the app, I should:
1. Check if there's a package.json to see what scripts are available
2. Likely need to start both the backend and frontend

Let me first check the package.json files to understand the available scripts.</details></think>

I'll help you run the app. Let me check the package.json files to see what scripts are available.

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/package.json

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/backend/package.json

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I can see:
1. Frontend runs with `npm run dev` (vite)
2. Backend runs with `npm run dev` in the backend directory

I should also check if there's a Makefile since I saw that in the project structure - it might have convenient commands to run both.</details></think>

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/Makefile

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see there's a Makefile with Docker setup. The easiest way to run the app is:
1. Use `make setup` if it's the first time (creates env files and starts docker)
2. Use `make start` if it's already set up

Let me check if docker-compose.yml exists and what it contains to understand the setup better.</details></think>

---

Great! I can see you have a Makefile set up with Docker. Let me check the docker-compose configuration to understand the setup:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/docker-compose.yml

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! The app uses Docker Compose with three services:
1. PostgreSQL database on port 5433
2. Backend API on port 3001
3. Frontend on port 5173

The simplest way to run everything is using the Makefile commands. I'll run `make start` to start all containers. If it's the first time, we might need `make setup` instead, but let's try start first.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Your app uses Docker Compose with three services: database, backend, and frontend. Let me start the app for you:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app && make start
```

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The app is now running. All containers are up and healthy. I should let the user know how to access it and maybe check the logs to ensure everything is running properly.</details></think>

Excellent! Your Family Hub app is now running! ðŸŽ‰

**Here's how to access it:**
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:3001/api
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on localhost:5433

All containers are up and healthy. The app includes:
- PostgreSQL database
- Express backend API
- React + Vite frontend

**Useful commands for managing the app:**
- `make stop` - Stop all containers
- `make restart` - Restart all containers
- `make logs` - View all logs
- `make logs-backend` - View backend logs only
- `make logs-frontend` - View frontend logs only
- `make rebuild` - Rebuild and restart containers

You can now open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to use the Family Hub application!
