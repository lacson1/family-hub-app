# Warning about unused build settings (2025-10-14 12:12Z)

_**User (2025-10-14 05:48Z)**_

12:44:11.174 WARN! Due to `builds` existing in your configuration file, the Build and Development Settings defined in your Project Settings will not apply. Learn More: https://vercel.link/unused-build-settings

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see you're getting a warning from Vercel about unused build settings. This warning occurs when you have a `builds` configuration in your `vercel.json` file, which overrides the build settings defined in your Vercel project dashboard.

Let me examine your current Vercel configuration to understand the issue and provide a solution.


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/vercel.json

---

I can see the issue. Your `vercel.json` file contains a `builds` configuration that's overriding the build settings in your Vercel project dashboard. This is causing the warning because Vercel prefers using the modern project settings approach.

Let me also check your package.json to understand your build setup:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/package.json

---

Now I understand your setup. You have a React + Vite application with TypeScript. The warning is occurring because you're using the legacy `builds` configuration in `vercel.json`. 

Here's how to fix this warning by modernizing your Vercel configuration:


---

Tool use: **search_replace**

Perfect! I've updated your `vercel.json` configuration to use the modern approach. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed the legacy `builds` configuration** - This was causing the warning
2. **Added modern Vercel configuration**:
   - `framework: "vite"` - Tells Vercel this is a Vite project
   - `buildCommand: "npm run build"` - Specifies the build command
   - `outputDirectory: "dist"` - Specifies where the built files are located

## Benefits:

- âœ… **Eliminates the warning** - No more "unused build settings" message
- âœ… **Uses modern Vercel configuration** - Follows current best practices
- âœ… **Maintains same functionality** - Your app will build and deploy exactly the same way
- âœ… **Better integration** - Vercel can now apply project-level build settings if needed

The configuration now uses Vercel's modern approach for static site generation with Vite, which is cleaner and eliminates the warning you were seeing. Your deployment process will remain exactly the same, but without the warning message.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating TypeScript References**

I need to update the devDependency from `@types/gapi.client.calendar` to `@types/gapi.client.calendar-v3` and change the triple-slash reference in `googleCalendar.ts`. The recommended reference tag should be `/// <reference types="gapi.client.calendar-v3" />`. However, types referencing `gapi.client.calendar.Event` might stay as is because the namespace could remain the same. I think I should edit `package.json` to replace the key and then run `npm install`. After that, Iâ€™ll update the file reference and run the build to check types.
**Implementing Edits**

I need to implement edits using `apply_patch`, and then follow up with running `npm install` and `build`. After that, I should commit the changes and push them. It's important to ensure proper indentation since the files use 4 spaces for that. Once I've applied the patch, I'll run the necessary terminal commands and make sure to update the todo statuses accordingly. Looks like it's time to get started on those edits!</details></think>

I see that there was an attempt with a version that doesnâ€™t exist. I need to identify the proper package name and version.

| Title | URL | Chunk |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Web Search Results |  | The warning message you're encountering indicates that the `@types/gapi.client.calendar` package is deprecated. This deprecation is due to a restructuring of type definitions for Google's APIs, leading to the creation of more specific packages like `@types/gapi.client.calendar-v3`. The deprecation notice suggests using `@types/gapi.client.calendar-v3` instead.<br/><br/>To resolve this issue, follow these steps:<br/><br/>1. **Uninstall the deprecated package**: Remove the old package from your project by running:<br/><br/>   ```bash<br/>   npm uninstall @types/gapi.client.calendar<br/>   ```<br/><br/><br/>2. **Install the recommended package**: Add the new package to your project with:<br/><br/>   ```bash<br/>   npm install --save @types/gapi.client.calendar-v3<br/>   ```<br/><br/><br/>This package provides TypeScript definitions for the Google Calendar API v3 and is maintained to stay up-to-date with the latest API changes. ([npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40types/gapi.client.calendar-v3?utm_source=openai))<br/><br/>By making this change, you'll ensure that your project uses the most current and supported type definitions for the Google Calendar API, eliminating the deprecation warning. |

I need to debug the application, likely by running both backend and frontend development as per the README. It sounds like a multi-step process: starting the backend, ensuring the database is up, viewing logs, and opening a browser.

I plan to use `docker-compose` to start the database and run a couple of commands in the background for long-running processes. I'll check for any updates on the `package.json` in the backend and run necessary commands just to be safe. Also, I'll create a todo list during this process!
**Executing commands in parallel**

I want to execute the necessary commands in parallel where possible. First, I'll run `docker-compose up db` to start the database. Then, Iâ€™ll run `npm install` in the backend and start the backend server. After that, I'll also start the frontend. Overall, it seems like a good idea to streamline these processes to save time. Iâ€™ll keep an eye on the status updates to ensure everything goes smoothly!</details></think>

I'll hit the frontend dev server to confirm it's serving, then wrap up the debug checklist.

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:5173 | head -n 5
```

- Backend is up: `GET http://localhost:3001/api/health` returns ok
- Frontend is serving: Vite dev server responding on `http://localhost:5173`

Anything specific you want me to debug next (errors, pages, API calls)?
