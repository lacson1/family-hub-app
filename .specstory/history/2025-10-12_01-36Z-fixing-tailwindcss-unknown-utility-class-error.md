_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The error message indicates that Tailwind CSS is having issues with the `index.css` file. The error mentions "Cannot apply unknown utility class `focus:`" and suggests there might be a CSS modules issue or missing `@reference` directive.

The error is happening at the `@import` line in `/Users/lacbis/fam/family-hub-app/src/index.css`. This looks like it might be a Tailwind CSS v4 issue, as the error message format and the mention of `@reference` directive suggests a newer version of Tailwind.

Let me first read the relevant files to understand the setup:
1. `src/index.css` - to see what's in there
2. `tailwind.config.js` - to see the Tailwind configuration
3. `postcss.config.js` - to see the PostCSS configuration
4. `package.json` - to see what versions are being used

This will help me understand the issue and provide a solution.</details></think>

I'll help you fix this Tailwind CSS error. Let me first examine the relevant files to understand the issue.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue now. The problem is on line 24 of `index.css`:

```css
@apply focus: outline-none focus-visible: ring-2 focus-visible: ring-blue-500 focus-visible: ring-offset-2;
```

There are spaces after the colons in `focus:`, `focus-visible:`, etc. The correct Tailwind syntax should be:
```css
@apply focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500 focus-visible:ring-offset-2;
```

The user is using Tailwind CSS v4 (as seen in the package.json with `@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.14"` and `"tailwindcss": "^4.1.14"`), and the error message is coming from the new Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS plugin.

The issue is that there are spaces between the variant prefix and the utility class name. In Tailwind, variants like `focus:`, `hover:`, `focus-visible:` should not have a space after the colon.</details></think>

I found the issue! On line 24 of your `index.css` file, there are spaces after the colons in the Tailwind utility classes. In Tailwind CSS, variant prefixes like `focus:` and `focus-visible:` should not have spaces after the colon.

Let me fix that for you:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've fixed the issue. The problem was that there were spaces after the colons in the Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `focus: outline-none` instead of `focus:outline-none`). This was causing Tailwind CSS v4 to interpret them as separate tokens, leading to the error about unknown utility class `focus:`.

The error should now be resolved, and the Vite dev server should work properly. Let me provide a clear explanation to the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. The problem was on line 24 of your `index.css` file where there were **spaces after the colons** in the Tailwind utility classes.

**What was wrong:**
```css
@apply focus: outline-none focus-visible: ring-2 ...
```

**Fixed to:**
```css
@apply focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 ...
```

In Tailwind CSS, variant prefixes (like `focus:`, `hover:`, `focus-visible:`) must be written **without any space** after the colon. The space was causing Tailwind to interpret `focus:` as an unknown utility class instead of recognizing it as a variant prefix.

Your Vite dev server should now work correctly! The error should disappear automatically if your dev server is running with hot module replacement.
